We work feverishly to make ourselves happy. So why are we so miserable? This manifesto helps us break free of our unhealthy devotion to efficiency and 
shows us how to reclaim our time and humanity with a little more leisure.

Despite our constant search for new ways to "hack" our bodies and minds for peak performance, human beings are working more instead of less, living 
harder not smarter, and becoming more lonely and anxious. We strive for the absolute best in every aspect of our lives, ignoring what we do well naturally 
and reaching for a bar that keeps rising higher and higher. Why do we measure our time in terms of efficiency instead of meaning? Why can't we just take 
a break?

In Do Nothing, award-winning journalist Celeste Headlee illuminates a new path ahead, seeking to institute a global shift in our thinking so we can stop 
sabotaging our well-being, put work aside, and start living instead of doing. As it turns out, we're searching for external solutions to an internal problem. 
We won't find what we're searching for in punishing diets or productivity apps. Celeste's strategies will allow you to regain control over your life and break 
your addiction to false efficiency. You'll learn how to increase your time perception to determine how your hours are being spent, invest in quality idle time, 
and focus on end goals instead of mean goals. It's time to reverse the trend that's making us all sadder, sicker, and less productive, and return to a way of 
life that allows us to thrive.
